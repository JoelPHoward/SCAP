## **2020-10-21 : Nebulosa and Scibet added**

We are excited to add two new features to SCAP with this update. 

1) You can now use [Nebulosa](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/Nebulosa/inst/doc/introduction.html#:~:text=Nebulosa%20is%20an%20R%20package,convolution%E2%80%9D%20of%20the%20cell%20features) to visualize expression of multiple features on your embeddings. Try it out in the Main tab.

2) We have added [SciBet](http://scibet.cancer-pku.cn/document.html) as a tool to rapidly annotate your data against one of > 90 prepared reference datasets. To find more details about SciBet and try out this new feature, head over to the SciBet tab and give it a try!
